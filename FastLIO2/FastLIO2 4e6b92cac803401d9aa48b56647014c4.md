### Notes:

- Keypoints: tightly-coupled iterated Kalman filter; The elimination of a hand-engineered feature extraction module; maintaining a map by an incremental k-d tree data structure, ikd-Tree;

### Abstract:

- Building on a highly efficient tightly-coupled iterated Kalman filter
- directly registering raw points to the map (and subsequently update the map, i.e., mapping) without extracting features
- maintaining a map by an incremental k-d tree data structure, ikd-Tree
- FAST-LIO2 is computationally-efficient (e.g., up to 100 Hz odometry and mapping in large outdoor environments), robust (e.g., reliable pose estimation in cluttered indoor environments with rotation up to 1000 deg/s), versatile (i.e., applicable to both multi-line spinning and solid-state LiDARs, UAV and handheld platforms, and Intel and ARM-based processors

### Conclusion:

This paper proposed FAST-LIO2, a direct and robust LIO framework significantly faster than the current state-of-theart LIO algorithms while achieving highly competitive or better accuracy in various datasets. The gain in speed is due to removing the feature extraction module and the highly efficient mapping. A novel incremental k-d tree (ikd-Tree) data structure, which supports dynamically point insertion, delete and parallel rebuilding, is developed and validated. A large amount of experiments in open datasets shows that the proposed ikd-Tree can achieve the best overall performance among the state-of-the-art data structure for kNN search in LiDAR odometry. As a result of the mapping efficiency, the accuracy and the robustness in fast motion and sparse scenes are also increased by utilizing more points in the odometry. A further benefit of FAST-LIO2 is that it is naturally adaptable to different LiDARs due to the removal of feature extraction, which has to be carefully designed for different LiDARs according to their respective scanning pattern and density.
