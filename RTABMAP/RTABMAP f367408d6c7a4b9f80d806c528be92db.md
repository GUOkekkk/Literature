[RTAB-Map as an Open-Source Lidar and Visual SLAM Library for Large-Scale and Long-Term Online Operation]([https://introlab.3it.usherbrooke.ca/mediawiki-introlab/images/7/7a/Labbe18JFR_preprint.pdf](https://introlab.3it.usherbrooke.ca/mediawiki-introlab/images/7/7a/Labbe18JFR_preprint.pdf)) This one has more details about how to use the odometry and it is a good one to conclude the different SLAM on ROS

### Notes:

- Try to get some idea about how to use the robot odometry information as the prior to improve the VO’s performance
- This paper mainly discusses how to solve the re-localization problem in an atmospheric periodically changing situation. But what I focus more on is the SLAM part

### Abstract:

- RTAB-Map started as an **appearance-based loop closure detection** approach with **the memory management** to deal with large-scale and long-term online operation
- For robots navigating using only a camera, illumination changes in indoor environments can cause re-localization failures during autonomous navigation
- The approach is tested on six mapping and six localization sessions recorded at 30 min intervals during sunset using a Google Tango phone in a real apartment.
- Questions:
    1. Which visual feature is the most robust to illumination variations in indoor environments
    2. To avoid having a human teleoperate a robot at different times of the day to create the multi-session map, would it be possible to acquire the consecutive maps simply by relocalizing from the map acquired in a previous session?
- good synchronization is important to avoid bad registration of the data

### Process:

A general structure:

The result of different features’ performance on the re-localization over time problem:

It could be found that the SuperGlue and SuperPoint really have impressive performance.

SuperPoint (with or without SuperGlue) is the most robust descriptor to large illumination variations, while binary descriptors such as BRIEF and BRISK are the most sensitive.

### Conclusion:

As a result, RTAB-Map is now a multi-purpose graph-based SLAM approach that can be used out-of-the-box by novice SLAM users and for prototyping on robot platforms with different sensor configurations and processing capabilities.
