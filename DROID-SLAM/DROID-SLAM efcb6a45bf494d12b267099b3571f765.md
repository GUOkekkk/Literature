### Notes:

- A popular Deep Visual SLAM

### Abstract:

- DROIDSLAM consists of recurrent iterative updates of camera pose and pixelwise depth through a Dense Bundle Adjustment layer.
- Despite training on monocular video, it can leverage stereo or RGB-D video to achieve improved performance at test time.
- Differentiable Recurrent Optimization-Inspired Design” (DROID)
- we iteratively update camera poses and depth. Whereas RAFT operates on two frames, our updates are applied to an arbitrary number of frames, enabling joint global refinement of all camera poses and depth maps, essential for minimizing drift for long trajectories and loop closures.
- each update of camera poses and depth maps in DROID-SLAM is produced by a differentiable Dense Bundle Adjustment (DBA) layer, which computes a Gauss-Newton update to camera poses and dense per-pixel depth so as to maximize their compatibility with the current estimate of optical flow

### Process:

We take a video as input with two objectives: estimate the trajectory of the camera and build a 3D map of the environment.

We adopt a frame-graph (V, E) to represent co-visibility between frames. An edge (i, j) ∈ E means image Ii and Ij have overlapping fields of view which shared points.
