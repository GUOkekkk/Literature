## [PnP-Net: A hybrid Perspective-n-Point Network]([https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.04626](https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.04626))

### Notes:

- A hybrid approach of deep learning method(provide a coarse estimation of the pose)and classical PnP
- Compared to the RANSAC, it does not improve the accuracy but by reducing the operation numbers to save the time
- The pipeline of this paper did not care about the feature detection and the object matching, it assumes these are given(which could be improved)
- The hybird could be a choice but although in this paper the author points out ***accurate PnP estimation is too difficult for existing neural networks,***  I think the pure network should work.

### Abstract:

- A hybrid approach that combines deep learning with model based algorithms, combine a deep learning initial phase followed by a model-based fine tuning phase.
- Experiments with deep learning on its own, suggest that accurate PnP estimation is too difficult for existing neural networks. But the computational complexity of  RANSAC-with-EPnP(classical method)the full and approximate searches is intractable for real-time practical systems.
- Use the network to robustly compute a coarse pose estimation then use it as initialization to an IRLS-LM solver and then jointly optimize both stages simultaneously in an end-to-end fashion.
- Remarkably, even though PnP-Net was trained on synthetic data, numerous experiments in different scenarios including real world data show accuracy similar to RANSAC with computational complexity on the order of classical LM.

### Conclusion:

The architecture involves a deep neural network that recovers a coarse but robust estimate, followed by traditional model-based optimization techniques that refines the estimates. Both stages are differentiable and are optimized in an end to end manner. Adding the detection and matching algorithms to the pipeline before PnP-Net and training both the detection network and our network in an end-to-end manner will probably improve both stages. Another interesting direction for future work is to train a neural network to output the likelihoods of each correspondence being wrong. These can be used as informative weights in the LM stage
