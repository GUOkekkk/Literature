### Notes:

- Maybe it could be helpful to improve the ICP performance
- It could save time but need to know the prior probability dirtribution

### Abstract:

- A novel combination of RANSAC plus Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) that uses the available prior probabilistic information from the EKF in the RANSAC model hypothesize stage
- This allows the minimal sample size to be reduced to one resulting in large computational savings
- It outperforms both in accuracy and computational cost the Joint Compatibility Branch and Bound (JCBB) algorithm, a gold-standard technique for spurious rejection within the EKF framework

### Process:

How to only use one point?

Figure 2 illustrates the idea behind 1-Point RANSAC in the same 2D line estimation problem. As the first key difference, the starting point is a data set and its underlying model, but also a prior probability distribution over the model parameters. **RANSAC random hypotheses are then generated based on this prior information and data points**, differently from standard RANSAC hypothesis solely based on data points. The use of prior information can reduce the size of the data set that instantiates the model to the minimum size of one point, and it is here where the computational benefit of our method with respect to RANSAC arises: according to Equation 1, reducing the sample size m greatly reduces the number of RANSAC iterations and hence the computational cost

In sequential SfM from video, smooth interframe camera motion can be reasonably assumed and this used to generated a prior distribution (prediction) of the motion.

### Result:

The error is still quite big

### Conclusion:

A novel RANSAC algorithm is presented in this paper which, for the first time and differently from standard purely data-driven RANSAC, incorporates a priori probabilistic information into the hypothesis generation stage. As a consequence of using this prior information, the sample size for the hypothesis generation loop can be reduced to the minimum size of 1 point data
