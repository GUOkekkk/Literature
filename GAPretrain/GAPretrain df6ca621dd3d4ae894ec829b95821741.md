## [Geometric-aware Pretraining for Vision-centric 3D Object
Detection]([https://arxiv.org/pdf/2304.03105v1.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2304.03105v1.pdf))

### Note:

- 3D object detection also contains the 3D object pose detection
- GAPretrain could be a component of other structures/backbones.

### Abstract:

- Multi-camera 3D object detection for autonomous driving is a challenging problem that has garnered notable attention from both academia and industry
- Recent approaches have utilized geometric-aware image backbones pretrained on depth-relevant tasks to acquire spatial information. However, these approaches overlook the critical aspect of view transformation, resulting in inadequate performance due to the misalignment of spatial knowledge between the image backbone and view transformation
- We propose a novel geometricaware pretraining framework called GAPretrain.
- Our approach incorporates spatial and structural cues to camera networks by employing the geometric-rich modality as guidance during the pretraining phase. we bridge this gap by using a unified birdâ€™s-eye-view (BEV) representation and structural hints derived from LiDAR point clouds.

### Conclusion:

In this work, we propose GAPretrain, an effective training strategy for multi-camera methods on the task of 3D object detection. Benefiting from the pretraining process, state-of-the-art camera-based methods gain further performance improvement. But as a learned neural network, the LiDAR model provides imperfect pretraining objectives in the BEV space. Moreover, due to the nature of the sparsity, BEV representations from LiDAR point cloud could not benefit the performance on objects at a large distance.
