## [Accelerated Coordinate Encoding: Learning to Relocalize in Minutes using RGB and Poses]([https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.14059](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.14059))

### Notes:

- close to my current project, but it is faster 300x than a DL method
- BTW, Eric Brachmann really leads this research track
- seems it knows a database of images and retrieved mapping pose ?
- some authors use neural radiance fields (NeRFs) for camera pose estimation

### Abstract:

- Learning-based visual relocalizers require hours or days of training. Since training needs to happen on each new scene again, long training times make learning-based relocalization impractical for most applications. (But why need to train for a new scene?)
- In this paper, we show how such a system can actually achieve the same accuracy in less than 5 minutes
- Using an MLP prediction head to optimize across thousands of view points(from feature extraction backbone) simultaneously in each single training iteration leads to stable and extremely fast convergence.
- Substitute effective but slow end-to-end training using a robust pose solver with a curriculum over a reprojection loss(PnP as the end?)
- Does not require privileged knowledge, such a depth maps or a 3D model(This part is impressive! But for the current project we could also use some DPT model)
- DSAC*  achieves state-of-the-art accuracy with 28MB networks, and acceptable accuracy with 4MB networks.

### Process:

A single RGB image I -> pose h 

As same as PnP problem:

Usually g consists of a PnP minimal solver in a RANSAC loop, followed by refinement. Refinement consists of iterative optimization of the reprojection error over all RANSAC inliers using Levenbergâ€“Marquardt.

To get the correspondences, we use a learnable layer to predict the 3D scene points for any 2d image location

Using an inlier threshold is interesting for the PnP transformer:

### Conclusion:

We have presented ACE, a relocalizer able to map new environments in 5 minutes. ACE reduces cost and energy consumption of mapping by two orders of magnitude compared to previous RGB-based scene coordinate regression approaches, making this family of algorithms practical. The changes from previous state-of-the-art relocalizers that we propose in this paper are mainly conceptual, leveraging decorrelation of gradients by patch-level training. We see further potential for speedups by clever engineering, such as interleaving buffer creation and training
